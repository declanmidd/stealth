Stealth is a powerful automation toolkit designed for generating and signing Android applications with embedded reverse shells. Leveraging the capabilities of msfvenom, this repository allows users to create custom Android APKs that initiate a Meterpreter session back to a specified IP address and port.

Key Features:

Payload Generation: Easily create reverse TCP payloads tailored for Android devices using msfvenom, making it straightforward to establish a remote session.

Keystore Management: Automates the generation of cryptographic keystores, ensuring that your APKs are properly signed and trusted by Android systems.

APK Signing: Integrates with jarsigner to sign the generated APKs, allowing for secure distribution and installation on target devices.

APK Alignment: Utilizes zipalign to optimize the APK for better performance and compatibility.

Stealth is intended for educational purposes and ethical hacking practices, providing a streamlined process for security professionals and researchers to test and validate mobile application vulnerabilities. Use responsibly!
